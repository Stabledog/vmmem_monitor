# vmmem_monitor Project

## Dev environment:
    - Requires the free MS C++ Build Toolkit
    - Use Windows Start menu to launch a Developer Command Prompt, and then `wsl.exe -- bash` in the project source dir.
       (This is how WSL inherits the suitable environment vars to build)
    - Within WSL shell, you can do `code .` and VSCode will then have the right environment also.
    - Set up a build task to invoke `make`

## Build:
